<h2>About AtChem on–line</h2>

<p>
AtChem on–line is a tool for running simulations of Master Chemical Mechanism using just your web browser, no installation is required. 
The user needs to supply two files: one with the chemical reactions and one with initial concentrations, change other parameters if necessary and press “Submit”. A link to a zip file with the results should appear soon.
</p>

<p>Currently there is one login 
for everyone – this will be changed in the future and users will need 
to register to receive an individual login. Until then, remember that everyone can access your data.
</p>

<p>
On the home page you can find links to example input files.
The set “simplest” describes a very simple model with one reaction. 
The set “allfiles” defines a larger model and contains all possible types of input file. The format of input files is described in detail below.
</p>
  <p>There is an online tutorial designed to lead you through the features of the AtChem on-line tool. It is available on the <a href="http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/atchem_tut/tutorial_intro.htt">MCM website</a></p>

<h2>Input data files</h2>

<h3>Mechanism file</h3>
<p>
<i>Mandatory.</i>
This file contains the chemical mechanism you wish to use. It must have extension “.fac”. All the 
reactions must be described in facsimile format, i.e. reaction rate, substrates and products, separated by signs “% : = ;”, i.e.
<br>
<code>% k : A + B + ... = C + D + ... ;</code>
<br>
The file must also contain the peroxy radical sum, i.e.<br>
<code>RO2 = RO2a + RO2b +...;</code> 
<br>
If there are no peroxy radicals, an empty sum should be used. 
Lines which do not start with “%” nor with “RO2=” are ignored.
</p>

<p>
Below is an example of a very simple mechanism file. The mechanism described contains only one reaction, A–>C occuring with reaction rate 1E-4 and there are no peroxy radicals.</p>
<pre>

RO2 =;

</pre>
<p>
A more complex example of mechanism file can be viewed <a href="https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/run/exdata/allfiles/mech.fac">here</a>.
Subset mechanisms from the <a href="http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/extract.htt">MCM website</a> should be downloaded in Facsimile format and are suitable for direct input to the model. <br>
</p>

<h3>Initial concentration file</h3>
<p><i>Mandatory.</i> 
This file must have extension <b>“.config”</b>. It should contain two columns: first with MCM names of the species and second with the concentration in molecules 
cm<sup>-3</sup>. Concentration of -1 means end of input – anything following will be ignored. An example of initial concentration file is below.
</p> 
<pre>
 O          2192.515962496984
 O3         5.356756840167577E+11
 NO3        14010.124722567038
end         -1
all below is ignored
 NO         1.0992718929324424E+8
 NO2        1.8473660738403264E+09
</pre>

<p>Any species not included in 
this file will initialize with a default value of 0. It is not necessary 
to initialize species which are going to be constrained. Environmental 
variables have separate input fields below and should not be included in this file. <br>
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p>
There are two types of constraints: species constraints and environmental 
constraints. These are provided as two zip files which contain a separate 
file for each constraint. Constraints can be provided on different timescales 
e.g. data every minute for NO and every hour for VOCs. The solver will 
interpolate between data points for less frequent data. </p>
<p><b>Important: When using constraining 
data the model start and stop time must be within the range of the constraining 
data to avoid undefined solver behaviour.</b> The model start time is 
set in the model parameters section and the end time is determined by 
the size and number of steps. <br></p>

<h3>Species constraints file</h3>
<p><i>Optional.</i> 
This is a zip file containing data for any species you wish 
to constrain. The data for each species is contained in a separate file 
which is named with the MCM name for the species e.g. CH3COCH3. The 
first line of each file should be the number of data points contained 
in the file. Following this each line should have 2 numbers separated 
by spaces; the first number is the time that the data point occurs at 
in seconds, the second number is the species concentration in molecules 
cm<sup>-3</sup>. </p>
<p>All the data files should be 
placed in 1 zipped file with the file extension “.zip” <br>
</p>
<h3>Environmental constraints file</h3>
<p><i>Optional.</i> This is a zip file containing data for any environmental 
parameter you wish to constrain and the files have the same format as 
the species constraints. The environmental constraints are temperature, 
H2O, relative humidity (RH) (NB only 1 of H2O and RH should be provided 
to the model), pressure, M, dilution rate (DILUTE), declination angle 
(DEC), boundary layer height, JFAC, ROOFOPEN and photolysis rates. With 
the exception of the photolysis rates if these parameters are being 
constrained then the appropriate input in the Environment variables 
section should be set to CONSTRAINED <br></p>

<h3>Concentration output file</h3>
<p><i>Optional.</i>
This is a file specifying which species concentrations you 
would like outputting from the model. It should be a list of MCM species 
names, 1 per line. This file should have the file extension “.config”</p>
<p>If this file is not provided 
by the user then the output will default to the same species as those 
in the initial concentrations file. The frequency of the output can 
be set in the model parameters section. <br></p>
  
<h3>Photolysis rates</h3>
<p><i>Optional.</i>
This file allows the user to specify a different photolysis rate parameterization 
to the default parameterization used in the MCM. The format should use 
the same 3 parameter configuration (J = l*cosX@m*EXP(-n*secX) ) and the file should have the extension'.rates'</p>
  <p>Example file: <a href="https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/run/exdata/allfiles/photolysis_rates.rates" target="_blank">https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/run/exdata/allfiles/photolysis_rates.rates</a>  <br></p>
 <p> The photolysis rates file can also be used to specify a constant rate for each photolysis rate. The format for this file is number, rate coefficeint and name and the file should have the extension '.const'</p>
<p>Example file: <a href="https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/run/exdata/allfiles/photolysis_rates.const" target="_blank">https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/run/exdata/allfiles/photolysis_rates.const</a>  <br></p>
<h2>Environment variables</h2>
  
<p>These can be given a fixed 
value or constrained to a data file provided in the environmental constraints 
zip file (set value to CONSTRAINED). Some variables (specified below) can be ignored (set value to NOTUSED). Some environmental variables can also be calculated by the model.
To use this feature the value should be set to CALC and the necessary additional inputs must be given; details of required inputs are given below. <br>
</p>
<p><b>M:</b> Number of air molecules (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>)</p>
  <p>    Can be calculated, requires temperature and pressure to be provided</p>
  <p> Cannot be NOTUSED</p>
  <p>    Default value=2.60e+19  </p>
  <p><b>TEMP:</b> Temperature (K)  </p>
  <p> Must be provided as a fixed value or constrained. CANNOT be calculated or NOTUSED
  Default value=281.95</p>
  <p><b>Pressure:</b> Torr   </p>
  Cannot be calculated. Default value= NOTUSED</p>

  <p><b>RH:</b> Relative humidity </p>
  <p> Cannot be calculated but can be NOTUSED provided H2O is given
(%)  Default value= NOTUSED</p>
<p><b>H2O:</b> Water concentration (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>)</p>
  <p>    Can be calculated, requires relative humidity to be provided</p>
  <p> Can be NOTUSED provided RH is given
  <p>    Default value=3.06e+17 </p>
<p><b>DEC:</b> Declination of 
the sun (radians)</p>
  <p>    Can be calculated, requires date to be provided</p>

  <p>    Cannot be set to "NOTUSED", must be fixed, constrained or calculated.</p>
      <p>    Default value=0.28782328e+00  </p>
<p><b>BOUNDARYLAYERHEIGHT:</b> 
Allows user to set the boundary layer height </p>
  <p>  
  Cannot be calculated.
  Default value= NOTUSED</p>
<p><b>DILUTE:</b> Dilution rate 
(s<sup>-1</sup>) </p>
  <p> 
  Cannot be calculated. Can be NOTUSED Default value= 6.77E-6</p>

<p><b>JFAC:</b> Factor used to 
correct calculated photolysis rates e.g. to adjust for cloudiness</p>
  <p>    Can be calculated by comparing a measured photolysis rate to that calculated by the model
    (currently only works for JNO2) requires JFAC species to be set and constraining data for this photolysis rate to be provided</p>
  <p>    Default value=NOTUSED  </p>
<p><b>ROOFOPEN</b>: Flag to turn 
photolysis rates on or off 0=off, 1=on. </p>
  <p> 
  Cannot be calculated. Can be NOTUSED. Default value is 1 <br>
</p>
<h2>Model Parameters</h2>
<p><b>Number of steps and step 
size:</b> The total time of the model run is determined by the number 
of steps and the step size. The step size controls how often the concentration 
output is produced. To run a model for 2 hours with output every 5 minutes 
would require a step size 300s and 24 steps <br></p>

<p><b>Max nr. of constrained species 
and Max. nr of constrained species</b>:</p>
<p>These control the maximum size 
of a constraint file and maximum number of constrained species and can 
usually be left as the default values <br></p>
<p><b>Rates output step size</b>: 
Frequency of output for the production and loss rates (seconds) <br>
</p>
<p><b>Model start time</b>: Seconds. 
If using constraining data the model start time must be within the range 
of the constraint data and the total run time of the model (determined 
by the number of steps and the step size) must give a model end time 
which is also within the range of the constraining data. <br>
</p>
<p><b>Jacobian output step size</b>: 
As this output is not commonly used it defaults to twice the model run 
time so it isn’t produced. This should only be altered if it is required 
and will produce very large files so should not be output too frequently 
as this may cause large models to crash. <br></p>

<p><b>Latitude and longitude</b>: 
Should be set to the location of the experiment  <br></p>
<p><b>Day, month and year</b>: 
Should be set to the date of the experiment <br></p>
<p><b>Inst. Rates output step 
size</b>: Frequency of output for the instantaneous rates for every 
reaction in the model (seconds). The output is produced as 1 file for 
each step and the name of the file corresponds to the time in seconds <br>

<p><b>Job name</b> – Only use 
A-Z0-9_– characters and do not use spaces. The server will append an 
integer to the name to ensure that each job has a unique ID. <br>

</p>
<p><b>Description</b> – this 
can be used to record any information you like about the model and is 
optional. <br></p>

<p><b>JFAC species:</b> Used to 
compare a constrained photolysis rate to the photolysis rate calculated 
by the model. The factor by which they differ is used to correct the 
other calculated photolysis rates. <br></p>
<p><b>Production and Loss rates 
output:</b> These are used to specify which species the production and 
loss rates should be output for.  <br></p>
